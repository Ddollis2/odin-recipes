        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most common mistakes people make when serving cheese is not letting it come to room temperature
            <br>first, so that all the flavors can be fully realized. This beautiful baked stuffed brie takes that principle to the next level.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small wheel of brie (about 6 to 8 inches), chilled</li>
            <li>¼ cup dried cranberries</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed, plus extra for (optional) design</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten with</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring knife. Cut directly on the "equator" through
                <br>the rind. Using a long piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the newly made cut. Loop
                <br>one end of the string over the other (a half knot). Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the
                <br>brie in half.</li>
            <li>Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back
                <br>together with the cranberries on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries or walnuts
                <br>that fell out.</li>
            <li>Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry.
                <br>Gently pull up edges to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim off the corners if there
                <br>is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite
                <br>side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary.
                <br>Flip the brie over so the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough against the brie. Brush the top
                <br>and sides of the wrapped brie with egg wash.</li>
            <li>If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough
                <br>to ensure sharp lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie in the freezer for one hour (this is
                <br>a crucial step; see note below).</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in preheated oven until it is browned and leaking
                <br>cheese, about 20 minutes. (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is about how long it takes
                <br>to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)</li>
        </ol>
